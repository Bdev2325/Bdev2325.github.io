## Project description

This project is an **automated web scraper** built using Python. Its primary purpose is to collect job listings from a sample job site and display  information about positions related to **Python**.

The scraper uses two core Python Libraries:
- **'requests'** - to fetch web pages.
- **'BeautifulSoup'** (from 'bs4') - to parse HTML and search for structured data.

Combinging these tools allows the program to automate the process of gathering and filtering job postings from a webpage.
It demostrates how webscraping techniques can be applied to extract meaningful information from HTML sources for analysis or automation.

## How to run the program

There are two prerequisites prior executing the program

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- The following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
Steps to Run:

1. Download or clone the repository containing test.py.
2. Open a terminal  in the directory containing the script.
3. (execute) Run the program with:

```bash
python test.py
```
4. The script connects to the sample site:
```
https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/
```
and outputs application links for the **Python-related** job listing.

## UI Design

User Tasks:
- The user simply runs the program from the terminal, no inputs are required.

**Program Functionally** (What the Program Does):
When executed, the program:
- Connects to the target website
- Downloads its HTML content.
- Parses the job listings section.
- Searches for job titles containing the keyword "Python".
- Extracts and displays the application links for these jobs.

The output gives users a quick way to view or access available Python-related job postings without manually browsing the site.

How It Works:

1. Import Libraries
   - Uses 'requests' for HTTP and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.
     
2. Fetch HTML Content
   
   ```python
   URl = "https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/"
   page = requests.get(URL)
   ```
3. Parse the Page
   
   ```python
   soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")
   ```
   Builds a searchable parse tree of the webpage.
   
4. Locate Job Listings Container

   ```python
   results = soup.find(id="ResultsContainer")
   ```
5. Filter for Python Jobs

   ```python
   python_jobs = results.find_all(
      "h2", string=lambda text: "python" in text.lower()
   )
   ```
6. Extract and Display Links

   ```python
   for job_element in python_jobs:
       links = job_element.find_all("a")
       for link in links:
           print(f"Apply here: {link['href']}\n")
   ```

## UI Design

- Requests + BeautifulSoup pairing: Lightweight and simple for HTTP + HTML parsing.
- Scoped searching: Targets only the main results container for accuracy.
- Keyword filtering: Uses a 'lambda' for flexible case-insensitive matching.
